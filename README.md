# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repository!

In this repo, I will be solving the Advent of Code problems using the Zig programming language.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to run the code locally and start solving the problems.

### Prerequisites

To run the code, you need to have the following installed:

- **Zig** (version 0.12.0 )

### Installing Zig

#### Windows

If you're on Windows, you can install Zig via **Chocolatey**:

```sh
# Using Chocolatey
choco install zig
```
### Cloning the Repository
## Clone this repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Fazlibeqir/AdventOfCode_2024.git
cd AdventOfCode_2024
```
### Running the Code
Once Zig is installed, follow the steps below to run the code for each day's challenge:

Navigate to the **src** directory where the Zig code is located:

```sh
cd src
```
Use the following command to run the solution:

```sh
zig run main.zig
```
This will execute the code and output the results for the day.

## File Organization
src/: Contains all Zig solutions.
